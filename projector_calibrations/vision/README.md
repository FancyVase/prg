<h1>Semi-automatic projector calibration system for multiple projectors in a single world space</h1>

I developed this system to facilitate the setup of the <a href=https://github.com/light-swarm>Lightswarm project</a> 
in the <a href=http://robotic.media.mit.edu/>Personal Robots Group</a> at the Media Lab in MIT.

Although the code is currently setup for three projectors, it can be modified for different projector arrangements.

calibration.py runs the entire calibration system by using the other modules.
